# interstellar-travel
Project to help learn Go. You can travel to a handful of planets but be careful not to run out of gas!

## Things I'll be implementing
* Structs
* Redis (maybe)
* Pointers

## Things still to do
* Create another struct item for traveler
    * Possibly traveler.broke for when we can't afford to go anywhere
* Create local packages to use
